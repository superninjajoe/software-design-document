-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  Draw It or Lose It is a game like a show in the ‘80’s called Win, Lose, or Draw. Teams compete to guess what the person is drawing. The application is meant to render images from a large stock image library drawing as clues. The game will consist of four 1-minute rounds. The images are rendered at a steady pace and fully revealed in 30 seconds. If the puzzle is not guessed correctly before the time expires, the opposing team will be allowed to take one guess to solve the puzzle with a 15-second timer.

  Draw It or Lose It will be a group game developed on the web. Their current game is only available for Android OS. It will be accessible to PC, iOS, and Android OS people. The game will allow one or more teams to play. Each team will be able to assign multiple players. Games and team names will be allowed to allow users to check if a name is in use when choosing team names. Only one instance of the game can exist in the memory at any time. Each game, team, or player will use a unique identifier.  

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I tried to paint everything in black and white and provide them with options to choose from. So they could make the best decision on what will work best for them. 

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Having the UML diagram was very helpful. I can understand what the client wants and how they want the code to work. It also tells me how each of the code will communicate with each other and how they each funtion. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I thought the development requirement could use better design. Possibly adding some more details or graphs comparing each system will paint a better picture for the client on each system compare to each other. 

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I tried to take the client's needs literal. They know what they want, they just need help putting everything together. That is where we come in. No different than an artist taking in a comission or a carpenter taking in a work order. It is important because it is a product they are paying for. It's like paying $85 for a birthday cake and getting something you could of baked yourself. 

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I tried to be direct with the design. Utilizing the UML diagram in the future, just to know how each piece of the code is meant to work with each other.
